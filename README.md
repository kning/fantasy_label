# Fantasy Label
"Fantasy football for music."

Each quarter, people "draft" artists and each week people "play" a selection of these artists. Users score points each week based on the performance of their selected artists on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. 

This repo is intended to house code to explore scoring systems and eventually build a prototype experience.
